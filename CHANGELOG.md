# Changelog

## v0.1.16 — 2026-02-18

- **API provider presets in right-click menu** — Groq, Ollama, OpenRouter, LM Studio as one-click radio items
- **Custom API dialog** — "Custom API..." opens a GTK4 dialog with Base URL, API Key, and Model fields; persists to DB
- **Local model size picker** — choose between Tiny (~75 MB), Base (~142 MB), Small (~466 MB), Medium (~1.5 GB)
- **D-Bus `set-api-config` action** — AI agents can programmatically configure custom API endpoints via JSON
- Provider and local model selection persists across restarts
- Switching between local model sizes auto-deletes the previous model to free disk space
- API key per-provider: stored in DB, looked up per preset on switch
- Providers that don't need an API key (Ollama, LM Studio) skip the key check
- AI Agent-Ready: fully controllable via D-Bus — switch providers, set custom endpoints, record/stop

## v0.1.15 — 2026-02-18

- Runtime transcription mode switching via right-click menu (API Mode / Local Mode radio items)
- Switching to Local auto-downloads the whisper model if missing, with progress display (MB / total MB)
- Switching to API deletes the local model file to free disk space
- Mode choice persists across restarts (saved to DB)
- App no longer panics on startup when API key is missing or model file is absent
- Guards: blocks recording during model download, blocks mode switch during recording/processing
- Graceful error handling: missing API key or model shows status message instead of crashing
